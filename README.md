Hangman Game


Description:

**classic Hangman game**   
This game challenges players to guess a randomly selected word within a limited number of attempts.
The game fetches a **random word** from an external API and provides an option to display its **definition** as a hint.  
Players must guess the word letter by letter, and incorrect guesses decrease the available attempts.  
The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or when the player runs out of attempts.
